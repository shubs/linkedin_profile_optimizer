# Linkedin profile optimizer

## Context

I was trying to get more views on my [Linkedin profile](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/sharmashubham1) in order to bring more awernace around my path and my current company.

Here is the user X, if this user visit the profile of user Y. User Y is going to get an email and a notification from linkedin to make him understand that his profile is getting visited by someone. So linkedin will provide a lot a call to action to make this user Y see back the profile user X.

Here is trick now, The User X (You) visit aumaticly as many profile as possible. All these users that user X visited are going to come back on on user X profile.

I personnaly, in 2 weeks grew from the 344 position in 1004 network to the 24th position. (Which is pretty cool right ?)
